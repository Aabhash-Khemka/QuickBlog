# QuickBlog - Blog Approval Workflow

## Overview
This document explains the new blog approval workflow implemented in QuickBlog, where normal users can submit blogs but they require admin approval before being published and shown to the public.

## How It Works

### 1. **User Blog Submission**
- **Any authenticated user** can submit a blog through `/submit-blog`
- Blogs are automatically set to `isPublished: false` and `isApproved: false`
- Users receive confirmation that their blog is under review
- Users can view their submitted blogs in their personal blog list

### 2. **Admin Review Process**
- **Admin users** can see all pending blogs in `/admin/pendingBlogs`
- Admins can **approve** blogs (making them visible to public)
- Admins can **reject** blogs with a reason
- Only approved blogs appear in the public blog listing

### 3. **Public Display**
- **Only approved and published blogs** are shown on the homepage
- Unapproved blogs are hidden from public view
- Users can still access their own unapproved blogs

## User Roles & Permissions

### **Regular Users (`role: "user"`)**
- ✅ Can submit blogs for review
- ✅ Can view their own blogs (approved or not)
- ✅ Can edit/delete their own blogs
- ❌ Cannot see other users' unapproved blogs
- ❌ Cannot approve/reject blogs

### **Admin Users (`role: "admin"`)**
- ✅ All regular user permissions
- ✅ Can view all pending blogs
- ✅ Can approve/reject blogs
- ✅ Can see all blogs regardless of approval status
- ✅ Can moderate content before it goes public

## Blog States

### **Submitted** (`isApproved: false`)
- Blog is created but not reviewed
- Only visible to author and admins
- Cannot be published until approved

### **Approved** (`isApproved: true`)
- Blog has passed admin review
- Can be published by author
- Will appear in public listings when published

### **Published** (`isPublished: true`)
- Blog is live and visible to everyone
- Must be approved first
- Can be unpublished by author

```

## New Routes

### **Public Routes**
- `/submit-blog` - Blog submission form for users
- `/my-blogs` - User's personal blog list (redirected after submission)

### **Admin Routes**
- `/admin/pendingBlogs` - Review pending blog submissions
- `/api/blog/pending` - Get pending blogs (API)
- `/api/blog/approve` - Approve/reject blogs (API)

## Blog Approval Process

### **Step 1: User Submission**
1. User navigates to `/submit-blog`
2. Fills out blog form (title, content, image, category)
3. Submits blog for review
4. Blog is saved with `isApproved: false`

### **Step 2: Admin Review**
1. Admin checks `/admin/pendingBlogs`
2. Reviews blog content and quality
3. Either approves or rejects with reason
4. If approved: `isApproved: true`, `approvedBy: adminId`, `approvedAt: timestamp`

### **Step 3: Publication**
1. Author can now publish their approved blog
2. Blog becomes visible to public
3. Appears in homepage and search results
